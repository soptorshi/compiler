# Final Semester Project

## C Compiler

### Folder Structure

```
src: containing all the source codes
obj: containing all the object files created; will be created during build
bin: containing the compiler binary or other binaries; will be created during build
```

### Build and run

```{.bash}
# building
make

# run
make run
```

### Coding Style

Try following a consistent coding style throughout the project. Using a tool like `clang-format` with a specific style. For now a `.clang-format` file is added, will see about it later.
